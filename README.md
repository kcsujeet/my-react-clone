# My React Clone

A simple react clone I made to better understand React basics. I was inspired by Swyx's [talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJP1E-Y-xyo&list=PLywJvIWKC67vwUDE5L05g8wiRGgneFX-n).

In this project, I implemented three react hooks.

1. useState
2. useEffect
3. useRef

The code for creating and updating the dom was taken from Swyx's implementation. Link for his implementation is [here](https://codesandbox.io/s/jsconfasia-final-forked-d1d933?file=/src/index.js).
